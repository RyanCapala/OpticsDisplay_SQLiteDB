# OpticsDisplay_SQLiteDB

In this project, I had to build an application for Android device utilizing the built in SQLiteOpenhelper for Android. This application will store the display eyewear, and the users in different SQLite Database.

Motivation of this project:
This project was an Idea of mine while working at a sunglass store called Oakley Vault. I was an optics specialist that is incharge of all the stock and display eyewear. The display eyewears does not have an easily accessible inventory guidelines. If the displays are missing, I have to go through hundreds of empty display boxes to find which ones are missing. That is when this project came to mind.

Features:
- This application will list all eyewears in each display case.
- The user will be able to edit each eyewear.
- It will also show the total count in each display case.
- The application will have a search capability for user convenience.
- The application will only have one administrator. The administrator are the only only one who can add or delete a user.
- The user can only edit the displays.
